The Hamlib specific dependencies on Windows platforms are:
- libwinpthread-1.dll 
for both x86 and x64,
and also
- libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll for x86 targets only. 

Those dependencies are installed from external/msvc/[x86|x64] dirs.

In addition, Hamlib also uses libusb but since it is a common
dependency with SoapySDR, it is not included in the external dirs.

For Hamlib v4.x releases, only the export file 'libhamlib-4.def' is provided, so we need to re-generate .lib to work on Visual Studio projects: 
- Open the 'Developper Command Prompt for VS 2022'
- For Win32, go to hamlib/32 directory and run 'LIB /DEF:libhamlib-4.def /MACHINE:X86'
- For Win64, go to hamlib/64 directory and run 'LIB /DEF:libhamlib-4.def /MACHINE:X64'
